"""Triage scoring for VC deal prioritisation.

Weighted model (cxhub-inspired):
  40% estimated impact   — revenue scale + margin quality
  30% strategic fit      — sector attractiveness + growth
  20% feasibility        — seller intent + deal stage readiness
  10% urgency            — how far along the deal is

Each dimension scored 1.0–5.0, then weighted to a single 1.0–5.0 total.
